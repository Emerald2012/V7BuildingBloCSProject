When you use this website:

1. Create an account, with your name, username and your country. Then add a profile picture of your choice and upload it. (EG: Jane Ong, EcoSaviour67, Ohio)
2. Login and you will see the homepage which is full of community initiatives and ideas from other users. You can like their posts.
3. After that, you can also post your own initiatives on the homepage as well, label the name, category and write the description of your initiative and its impact to society then post it for everyone to see.
4. Then, you can go to the Earth Simulator and use the controls to control the state of the Earth by sliding the circles on the toggles.
5. After that, you can ask AI some prompts like "How to be more eco-friendly?" or "How to recycle well?"
6. Explore and enjoy the experience!
